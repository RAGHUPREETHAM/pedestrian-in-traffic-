Pedestrians are an important part of urban traffic systems, and ensuring their safety is a critical priority. Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to address pedestrian-related challenges in traffic systems, such as detection, tracking, recognition, and behavior analysis. These methods are aimed at reducing the likelihood of accidents, optimizing traffic flow, and improving the overall safety of pedestrians.


To develop machine learning models for pedestrian detection and tracking in traffic, large amounts of annotated pedestrian data are required. There are several publicly available datasets that can be used for training and evaluating pedestrian detection and tracking models.Here are some of the popular datasets for pedestrian detection and tracking:Caltech Pedestrian Dataset, CityPersons Dataset, KITTI Dataset.
